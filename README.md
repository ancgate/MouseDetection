Phase 1

A simple demo JavaFx proram, which willl have a rectangle at the top and when mouse enter that rectanble, 
the progam records the mouse coordinates and records X and Y values and save them in the ArrayList.

A text area in the same form and when user starts typing in that text area time is stored for every 3 characters types. 
This number 3 should be variable we would like to set the number of characters after which the program should records the time spent. 

All results are shown in the console.

Phase 2 
1) Below the rectangle there will be button saying "Draw" whcih will draw lines from point a to point b for every 5th cordinate in the list. 
2) Store the time in an ArrayList and show that in the lebel below the text area
